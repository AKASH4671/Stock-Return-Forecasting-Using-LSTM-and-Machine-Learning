# 📈 Stock Return Forecasting Using LSTM & Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning — especially **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks — can be applied to forecast short-term stock returns using historical lag features. It also compares traditional models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, offering practical insights into their strengths and limitations.

> 📊 Blends concepts from AI, time-series forecasting, and financial return behavior  
> 🧠 Built to deepen practical understanding of sequential modeling in finance  
> 💼 Reflects the intersection of data science and modern quantitative analysis

## 📊 Problem Statement

Can we forecast short-term **stock return movements** using only past return data (lagged features)?  
This simulates what many **quantitative models** in trading and portfolio construction attempt.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Predict next-day returns based on past patterns
- Compare performance of **tree-based models** vs. **deep learning**
- Build a reusable ML pipeline (scaling, saving, evaluation)
- Explore sequential modeling with LSTM for financial time series

## 📈 Performance Summary (on Tesla Returns)

| Model        | MAE      | RMSE     | R² Score  |
|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Random Forest| 0.03165  | 0.00191  | -0.0201   |
| XGBoost      | 0.03291  | 0.00208  | -0.1084   |
| LSTM         | 0.03226  | 0.04449  | -0.0545   |

> 📌 **Insight**:  
> While LSTM is built for sequences, simpler tree-based models like Random Forest outperformed it here — possibly due to the limited input features (no volume, no technical indicators).
This shows the importance of feature richness in deep learning for finance.
